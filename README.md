# Anisotropy-Normalization---SEVI

This file is intended to read in SEVI spectra and normalize the anisotropies measured in a scan (or averaged scan) as output by Origin. Please note that the input file should contain the number of counts for e- events in column 2, the anisotropy in column 3, and the eBE in column 4.

The code for this is largely based on the work I did on PL_Master, so see that documentation for questions or contact me at MarkCBabin@gmail.com
